  <p>WHO I AM: I love to lead from the front, push those around me to succeed and fine innovative, outside the box solutions. After serving six years in the United States navy, I have developed skills as an Electronics Technician and as a Technical
    Systems Leader. Learning attention to detail and how to work in high stress scenarios that allow me to thrive and always push myself to the next level of knowledge or technical expertise. After all my growth and development with the Navy, I have
    continued to push myself, to learn more ways to solve problems, approach business strategy, build and manage relationships, and most importantly, to help people develop skill to help the project.</p>
  <p>WHAT I DO: I help technical companies improve personnel productivity by providing creative problem solutions based cross functional team leadership, strategic planning and business intelligence.</p>
  <p>WHY IT WORKS: When creative problem solving and innovative thinking is the starting point for your company's leadership, you get the most efficient, effective, and visible business solutions that clients, and potential clients are looking for
    right now.</p>
  <p>WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT: I know what it means to be in a life or death, sunk or swim situation. I know how high the stakes can be and how minutes or seconds can make the difference. I have learned to be cool under the pressure that the military
    can create, and I bring that level headed, big picture outlook to all things that I do.</p>
